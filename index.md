# 👋 Hi, I’m Alizea Alvarez-Sookram, LMSW

**Focus:** Evaluation • Data Governance • Policy & Ethics  

Welcome! I'm Alizea Alvarez-Sookram, and I believe good data and thoughtful evaluation can drive meaningful change, especially when equity, collaboration, and community voice are at the core.  

This portfolio highlights some of the projects I’ve worked on in evaluation, data governance, and policy, each one a step in my journey to positioning myself at the intersection of evaluation and governance, where the big question is:

➡️ How do we design data systems that make meaningful evaluation possible?

This means helping organizations not only learn from their programs but also set up the structures, standards, and governance practices that make ongoing, equity-driven evaluation feasible.

## 👩‍💻 About Me
I’m a social worker by training and a current Master’s student in Program Evaluation & Data Analytics at Arizona State University, graduating in December 2025. My career started in direct practice, but I realized I wanted to take the values that guide me, equity, justice, and community voice, and bring them into the systems that shape programs on a larger scale.  

That’s what led me into evaluation and data analysis. I see evaluation not just as a reporting function, but as a way to strengthen the infrastructure of social programs so they can keep learning, improving, and serving communities more effectively.  

So far, I’ve:  
- Partnered with the City of Phoenix to design a governance model for its Shade Data Plan.  
- Developed outcome evaluation frameworks and data audits for ThriveKids, a youth mental health initiative in New Orleans.  
- Analyzed policy options around school-based mental health and the use of AI in youth well-being.  

These projects represent my shift from micro-level work into macro and mezzo spaces, shaping systems and policies that can sustain real social change. Outside of work and school, I’m a curious traveler and avid fiction reader, always looking for the next city, country, or local market stall to visit. I really believe the best way to learn about a place and its culture is through its food, where history, community, and creativity all come together.
