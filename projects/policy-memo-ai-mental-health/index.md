# 📝 Policy Analysis – AI & Youth Mental Health
**Role:** Policy Analyst – PAF 509: Public Policy (ASU)   
**Timeline:** Summer 2025   
**Focus:** Policy Options for Governing Emerging Technologies   

## 📌 Overview
During my Public Policy course, I conducted a multi-stage policy analysis examining how artificial intelligence (AI) tools — including chatbots and early-warning systems — are entering youth mental health spaces. The central policy question: How should policymakers govern emerging AI technologies to maximize benefits while mitigating risks for youth well-being? 

## 🔄 My Process
- **Problem Characterization** → Mapped the scope, magnitude, and distribution of risks (e.g., reliance on AI companions, data privacy, equity of access).
- **Comparative Policy Analysis** → Researched and synthesized regulatory precedents and state/federal strategies.
- **Policy Option Development** → Built out three approaches:
      - *California Safety Standards Model* (Option A)
      - *State-Level Bans/Restrictions* (Option B)
      - *Federal Public Health Guidance* (Option C)
- **Policy Recommendation** → Proposed a layered governance model prioritizing safety standards while drawing on federal advisories, using bans only for high-risk cases.
- **Supporting Briefs** → Produced three briefs to inform the memo: problem framing, crisis detection & support, and policy option trade-offs.

## 📂 Key Deliverables
- **Final Policy Memo:** Governing Emerging Technologies: Policy Options for AI Tools in Youth Mental Health.
- **Three Policy Briefs:** Shorter analyses supporting the final recommendation.
- **Comparative Policy Table:** Synthesized options with strengths/weaknesses.
- **Annotated Research Base:** Academic, regulatory, and practitioner sources. 

## 🛠️ Skills
- **Policy Analysis:** Problem characterization, comparative analysis, option evaluation.
- **Research & Synthesis:** Academic articles, regulatory frameworks, practitioner perspectives.
- **Reporting:** Clear policy briefs and executive memo writing.
- **Equity & Ethics Lens:** Evaluated risks around mental health, equity, and data governance.

## 🌟 Impact
This project advanced my ability to bridge policy analysis and mental health practice, producing actionable recommendations at the intersection of AI governance, youth well-being, and public policy. It demonstrates my capacity to translate technical risks into policy strategies that are both evidence-based and politically feasible.
