# 📝 Policy Analysis – AI & Youth Mental Health
**Role:** Policy Analyst – PAF 509: Public Policy (ASU)   
**Timeline:** Summer 2025   
**Focus:** Policy Options for Governing Emerging Technologies   

## 📌 Overview
During my Public Policy course, I conducted a multi-stage policy analysis examining how artificial intelligence (AI) tools — including chatbots and early-warning systems — are entering youth mental health spaces. The central policy question: How should policymakers govern emerging AI technologies to maximize benefits while mitigating risks for youth well-being? 

## 🔄 My Process
- **Problem Characterization** → Mapped the scope, magnitude, and distribution of risks (e.g., reliance on AI companions, data privacy, equity of access).
- **Comparative Policy Analysis** → Researched and synthesized regulatory precedents and state/federal strategies.
- **Policy Option Development** → Built out three approaches:
    - *California Safety Standards Model* (Option A)   
    - *State-Level Bans/Restrictions* (Option B)   
    - *Federal Public Health Guidance* (Option C)
- **Policy Recommendation** → Proposed a layered governance model prioritizing safety standards while drawing on federal advisories, using bans only for high-risk cases.
- **Supporting Briefs** → Produced three briefs to inform the memo: problem framing, crisis detection & support, and policy option trade-offs.

## 📂 Key Deliverables
- **[Final Policy Memo (PDF)](Final-Policy-Memo.pdf):** *Governing Emerging Technologies: Policy Options for AI Tools in Youth Mental Health.* This memo evaluates three major policy alternatives (California’s safety standards model, state bans/restrictions, and federal public health guidance) and recommends a layered governance approach that prioritizes safety standards while leveraging federal advisories and targeted bans.  
- **[Policy Brief – Characterizing the Policy Problem (PDF)](Characterizing-the-Policy-Problem-AI-in-Youth-Mental-Health.pdf):** Explores the magnitude and distribution of AI in youth mental health, highlighting inequities in access and the risks of fragmented governance.  
- **[Policy Brief – From Alerts to Care (PDF)](From-Alerts-to-Care-Governing-AI-That-Detects-and-Supports-Youth-in-Crisis.pdf):** Examines crisis detection and early-warning AI tools, weighing their potential against cases of harm and exploring governance strategies to connect alerts to reliable human care.  
- **[Policy Brief – Policy Options (PDF)](Policy-Options-for-AI-Tools-in-Youth-Mental-Health.pdf):** Analyzes three governance approaches, safety standards, bans, and federal advisories, and situates them within competing problem definitions across jurisdictions.  

## 🛠️ Skills
- **Policy Analysis:** Problem characterization, comparative analysis, option evaluation.
- **Research & Synthesis:** Academic articles, regulatory frameworks, practitioner perspectives.
- **Reporting:** Clear policy briefs and executive memo writing.
- **Equity & Ethics Lens:** Evaluated risks around mental health, equity, and data governance.

## 🌟 Impact
This project advanced my ability to bridge policy analysis and mental health practice, producing actionable recommendations at the intersection of AI governance, youth well-being, and public policy. It demonstrates my capacity to translate technical risks into policy strategies that are both evidence-based and politically feasible.
