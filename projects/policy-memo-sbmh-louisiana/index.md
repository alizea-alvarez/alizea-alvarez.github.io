# 📝 Policy Memos – School-Based Mental Health (SBMH)
**Role:** Policy Analyst – PAF 505: Public Policy, Arizona State University
**Timeline:** Summer 2025
**Focus:** Policy Analysis & Evidence-Based Recommendations

## 📌 Overview
As part of my Public Policy coursework, I completed a series of staged assignments that culminated in a final policy memo titled Strengthening School-Based Mental Health Services in Louisiana: Policy Options and Recommendations. The memo analyzed Louisiana’s SBMH crisis and proposed actionable solutions for expanding equitable access.

## 🔄 My Process
- **Problem Identification** → Defined the SBMH crisis as both a magnitude and distributional issue, disproportionately affecting low-income and racially marginalized students.
- **Political Context Analysis** → Examined competing problem definitions, including opposition to DEI frameworks and funding instability.
- **Comparative Policy Options** → Evaluated three major pathways:
          - *Federal Grant Funding* (inducement tools)
          - *Workforce Development* (capacity-building tools)
          - *State-Level Staffing Mandates* (authority tools)
- **Supporting Briefs** → Produced three briefs to inform the memo each focusing on framing, measurement, analysis, and alternatives.
- **Final Recommendation** → Advocated a phased approach: immediate Federal Grant Funding for relief, medium-term Workforce Development for sustainability, and long-term State Mandates to institutionalize equity.

## 📂 Key Deliverables
- **Final Policy Memo:** Governing Emerging Technologies: Policy Options for AI Tools in Youth Mental Health.
- **Three Policy Briefs:** Shorter analyses supporting the final recommendation.
            - *Characterizing the Policy Problem: AI in Youth Mental Health*
            - *From Alerts to Care: Governing AI That Detects and Supports Youth in Crisis*
            - *Policy Options for AI Tools in Youth Mental Health*

## 🛠️ Skills
- **Policy Analysis:** Problem definition, option evaluation, political context.
- **Research & Synthesis:** Peer-reviewed articles, policy frameworks, government data.
- **Writing for Policy Audiences:** Concise memos, briefs, and executive summaries.
- **Equity Lens:** Culturally responsive and justice-focused framing of solutions.

## 🌟 Impact
This sequence demonstrates my ability to conduct end-to-end policy analysis: from defining a complex public problem to evaluating alternatives and producing actionable, equity-driven recommendations. It also showcases a layered skillset: research, synthesis, and professional policy communication.
