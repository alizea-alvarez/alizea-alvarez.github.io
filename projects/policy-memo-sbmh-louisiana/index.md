# 📝 Policy Memos – School-Based Mental Health (SBMH)
**Role:** Policy Analyst – PAF 505: Public Policy, Arizona State University   
**Timeline:** Summer 2025   
**Focus:** Policy Analysis & Evidence-Based Recommendations   


## 📌 Overview
As part of my Public Policy coursework, I completed a series of staged assignments that culminated in a final policy memo titled Strengthening School-Based Mental Health Services in Louisiana: Policy Options and Recommendations. The memo analyzed Louisiana’s SBMH crisis and proposed actionable solutions for expanding equitable access.

## 🔄 My Process
- **Problem Identification** → Defined the SBMH crisis as both a magnitude and distributional issue, disproportionately affecting low-income and racially marginalized students.
- **Political Context Analysis** → Examined competing problem definitions, including opposition to DEI frameworks and funding instability.
- **Comparative Policy Options** → Evaluated three major pathways:  
  - *Federal Grant Funding* (inducement tools)  
  - *Workforce Development* (capacity-building tools)  
  - *State-Level Staffing Mandates* (authority tools)  
- **Supporting Briefs** → Produced three briefs to inform the memo each focusing on framing, measurement, analysis, and alternatives.
- **Final Recommendation** → Advocated a phased approach: immediate Federal Grant Funding for relief, medium-term Workforce Development for sustainability, and long-term State Mandates to institutionalize equity.
