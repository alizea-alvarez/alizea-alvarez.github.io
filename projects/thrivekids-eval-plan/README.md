# 🌱 ThriveKids Evaluation Plan
**Role:** Graduate Consultant – Children’s Hospital New Orleans (ThriveKids Program)
**Timeline:** Summer 2025
**Focus:** Outcome Evaluation & Monitoring Frameworks

## 📌 Overview
ThriveKids provides care coordination, school-based mental health services, and outpatient supports for students across Orleans and Jefferson Parish schools. The program wanted to better understand its impact on student well-being and academic performance but lacked a structured system for evaluation. I was engaged to design a comprehensive evaluation plan that included measurable indicators, data collection strategies, and culturally responsive frameworks.

- **M&E Plan:** Tools and matrices for tracking progress, linked to program goals.
- **Logic Model & Theory of Change:** Visual representation of ThriveKids’ pathway to impact.
- **Recommendations:** Guidance for strengthening data collection and aligning measures to program objectives.

## 🛠️ Skills
- **Evaluation Design:** Logic models, theories of change, outcome mapping, indicator frameworks.
- **Applied Methods:** M&E matrices, culturally responsive evaluation approaches.
- **Communication:** Drafted deliverables for both staff and leadership, ensuring usability.
  
## 🌟 Impact
