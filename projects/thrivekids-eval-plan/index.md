# üå± ThriveKids Evaluation Plan
**Role:** Graduate Consultant ‚Äì Children‚Äôs Hospital New Orleans (ThriveKids Program)     
**Timeline:** Summer 2025 **(Ongoing)**    
**Focus:** Outcome Evaluation & Monitoring Frameworks     

## üìå Overview
ThriveKids provides care coordination, school-based mental health services, and outpatient supports for students across Orleans and Jefferson Parish schools. The program wanted to better understand its impact on student well-being and academic performance but lacked a structured system for evaluation. I was engaged to design a comprehensive evaluation plan that included measurable indicators, data collection strategies, and culturally responsive frameworks.

## üìÇ Key Deliverables
