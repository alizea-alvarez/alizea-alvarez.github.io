# 🌳 Phoenix Shade Data Plan
**Role:** Evaluation Consultant – Office of Heat Response & Mitigation (OHRM), City of Phoenix
**Timeline:** Fall 2025 – Ongoing  
**Focus:** Data Governance & Interdepartmental Accountability  

## 📌 Overview
Phoenix’s Shade Plan aims to expand equitable access to cooling infrastructure citywide, but lacked a coordinated system for tracking shade metrics across departments. I was brought on to design a governance framework, data standards, and accountability structures that would enable the City to measure progress, report on milestones, and prepare for future integration of AI and climate analytics.  

## 🔄 My Process
- **Project Charter & Work Plan** → Defined goals, research questions, methodology, and phased deliverables.
- **Literature Review & Benchmarking** → Analyzed international case studies and U.S. city strategies to identify best practices in data governance.
- **Data Centralization** → Compiled shade metrics into an Excel-based tracker, mapping departmental responsibilities, milestones, and reporting indicators.
- **Governance Framework** → Designed a four-phase model including Standards of Work, liaison networks, submission templates, and centralized reporting.
- **Collaboration** → Presented synthesized findings and draft models to OHRM leadership, gathering feedback and refining deliverables.

## 📂 Key Deliverables
- **Literature Review:** Evidence-based recommendations, blending municipal practice with academic research. **Completed**
- **Criteria for Data Collection:** Draft guidance for ensuring metrics are consistent and reportable. **Completed**
- **Excel System:** Centralized shade metrics by department, with milestones and responsibilities. **Ongoing** 
- **Draft Standard of Work (SoW):** Outlined rules, templates, and reporting standards for departmental submissions. **Ongoing**
- **Governance Model:** A framework balancing standardization, flexibility, and accountability across departments. **Ongoing**

## 🛠️ Skills
- **Evaluation Design & Governance:** Developed phased project framework, governance model outline, and criteria for reportable data to strengthen accountability and consistency.
- **Project Planning:** Created project charter, outline, and week-by-week work plan to structure applied capstone and city deliverables.
- **Data Organization:** Compiled citywide Shade Plan metrics in Excel, aligning departmental responsibilities, milestones, and impact indicators.
- **Applied Research Methods:** Conducted literature review, comparative case studies, and stakeholder-informed design to ground recommendations in tested practices.
- **Governance Framework Development:** Designed Standard of Work draft, liaison accountability structure, submission templates, and feedback loops for sustainable interdepartmental reporting.
- **Communication & Stakeholder Engagement:** Translated findings into accessible deliverables for OHRM leadership and staff, ensuring usability and adoption. 

## 🌟 Impact
This project is helping Phoenix establish a future-ready governance system for its Shade Plan. By centralizing data, setting clear reporting standards, and creating liaison networks, OHRM will be positioned to track progress on equity-driven shade initiatives and prepare for integration of emerging technologies like AI.
